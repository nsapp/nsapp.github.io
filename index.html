        <h1>It's Ya Boi</h1>
        <p>Hi, welcome to the worst website on the internet, the product of too much of my free time. I wasted an ssl certificate on this bad boi
        just so I could look like a cool kid. See that green lock in the address bar? You're welcome, friend.</p>

        <h3>Random Projects</h3>
        <p>Random work of mine will appear on this site like magic when I get bored in class. It won't be quite like magic because it'll require
        effort on my part, but you get the idea.</p>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Terrible Content</h3>
        <p>I mean I don't even know what to say. If you actively come here, get ready for the worst content you've ever seen.</p>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Another Box</h3>
        <p>I just needed a third box to keep the website from getting completely messed up, I'm bad at CSS leave me alone. And maybe I need just a bunch
        of text in these things to force the footer into place? I really have no idea what's going on here.</p>
